# Summary of my projects
Below are brief descriptions and links to various portfolio projects I have completed. These projects show my ability to gather, clean, explore, and understand data, as well as use statistics and machine learning models with visualizations to draw interesting conclusions and make predictions from the dataset. Please contact me if you have any questions or would like to speak further.

<b>1. Predicting Wide Receiver Fantasy Football Scores:</b> https://github.com/mborysiak/Predicting-Wide-Receiver-Fantasy-Points

This project aims to predict the fantasy football scores of NFL wide receivers. It scrapes individual player receiving and team passing data from pro-football-reference.com for the 2000â€“2016 seasons (n=~2200). The data is cleaned and merged prior to feature engineering. The final dataset is transformed using principal component analysis (PCA) and then modeled using linear regression and k-fold cross-validation. All work was performed independently.

<b>2. Analysis of Teen Birth Rates:</b> https://github.com/mborysiak/Factors-Affecting-Teen-Pregnancy-Rate

This project looked at over 50 factors that could potentially contribute to teen birth rates in various states. The most important factors for predicting teen birth rate on a state-level were determined using a (regularized) linear regression model. I gathered, cleaned, and analyzed the data independently. 

<b>3. Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA and LSTM:</b> https://github.com/mborysiak/Time-Series-Forecasting-with-ARIMA-and-LSTM

Using various Google Trends and S&P 500 historical data, I compared the performance of AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for forecasting time series data. I also examined how using Gaussian filtering could help improve the predictions on out-of-sample data. Search trends explored include LeBron James, Olympics, Kentucky Derby, colbrew, Zika virus, and Gilmore Girls.

<b>4. Predicting Home Prices in Aimes, IA (Kaggle Competition):</b> https://github.com/mborysiak/Predicting-Ames-Housing-Prices

I completed this project as part of a Kaggle competition (see here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). I visualized the various aspects of the dataset prior to cleaning null values and performing feature engineering such as transforming nominal variables and addressing null values. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) decision-tree algorithm was used for modeling and prediction, with my results ranking in the top 30% of Kaggle with relatively minimal coding.

<b>5. Analysis of SAT scores in New York City:</b> https://github.com/mborysiak/Analysis-of-SAT-Scores-in-New-York-City

This project gathers, cleans, and combines data from various sources into a coherent database for exploring predictors of SAT scores for students in New York City. I began this project as part of the DataQuest (dataquest.io) Data Science program, before extending the analysis to include linear regression modeling with regularization.

<b>6. Exploring Gun Deaths in the US:</b> https://github.com/mborysiak/Analysis-of-Gun-Deaths-in-America

This was my first project in the DataQuest program. It uses lower level programming without pandas to combine and explore the dataset. Various stastical metrics related to gun deaths (homicide vs. suicide; race; and time of year) are analyzed.
