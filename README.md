# Summary of my projects
Below are brief descriptions and links to various portfolio projects I have completed. These projects show my ability to gather, clean, explore, andunderstand data, as well as use statistics and machine learning models with visualizations to draw interesting conclusions from the dataset. Please contact me if you have any questions or would like to speak further.


<b>1. Analysis of Teen Birth Rates:</b> https://github.com/mborysiak/Factors-Affecting-Teen-Pregnancy-Rate

This project looked at over 50 factors that could potentially contribute to teen birth rates in various states. The most important factors for predicting teen birth rate on a state-level were determined using a linear regression model. I gathered and cleaned the data independently. 

<b>2. Analysis of SAT scores in New York City:</b> https://github.com/mborysiak/Analysis-of-SAT-Scores-in-New-York-City

This project gathers, cleans, and combines data from various sources into a coherent database for exploring predictors of SAT scores for students in New York City. I began this project as part of the DataQuest (dataquest.io) Data Science program, before extending the analysis to include linear regression modeling with regularization.

<b>3. Cleaning a Star Wars dataset:</b> https://github.com/mborysiak/Star-Wars-Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis

This project takes an existing dataset from 538 and performs various cleanings to improve usability. Basic statistical metrics are explored to find out the movies with highest rankings, viewership, etc. This project also began as part of the DataQuest program.

<b>4. Exploring Gun Deaths in the US:</b> https://github.com/mborysiak/Analysis-of-Gun-Deaths-in-America

This was my first project in the DataQuest program. It uses lower level programming without pandas to combine and explore the dataset. Interesting statistics and correlations are found.
